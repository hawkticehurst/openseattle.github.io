## Development

The site uses Gatsby, a React-based static site generator. Learn more about Gatsby [here.](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)

We are also using a plugin for using Markdown and React together. You can learn more about it [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/mdx/).

We use Prettier for automatic JavaScript formatting. Use the `npm run format` command to run code formatting or we recommend downloading the [Prettier extension](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html) for your editor of choice to enable features like formatting on save.
