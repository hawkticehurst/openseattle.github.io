## Open source & local communities

Open Seattle advocates for open data and civic technology projects that improve the lives of Seattle residents.
We host monthly meetups where members pitch and work on projects, and build relationships between tech workers, community groups, and local government.

## Get Involved

Open Seattle meets on the fourth Wednesday of every month to discuss and work on civic technology projects. RSVP for our next meetup and keep track of all of our events on our Meetup page.
