## Open source & local communities

Open Seattle advocates for open data and civic technology projects that improve
the lives of Seattle residents. We host monthly meetups where members pitch and
work on projects, and build relationships between tech workers, community groups,
and local government.

## Get Involved

Open Seattle meets on the fourth Wednesday of every month to discuss and work on
civic technology projects. RSVP for our next meetup and keep track of all of our
events on our Meetup page. Want to pitch a project at our next meetup? Get in touch!

Are you a Seattle nonprofit that needs some tech help? Have an idea how to make
your community better? You've come to the right place. Fill out our Contact Us form

Are you a Seattleite dev, designer, data person, etc. looking to use your skills for
the greater good and build your resume? Maybe youâ€™re looking to pick up a new tech
skill. You, too, have come to the right place. Sign up for our meetups or join us on
Slack.
